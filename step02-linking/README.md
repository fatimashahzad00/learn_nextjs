## Linking and Navigation

There are two ways to navigate between routes in Next.js:

Using the <Link> Component
Using the useRouter Hook

<Link> Component
<Link> is a built-in component that extends the HTML <a> tag to provide prefetching and client-side navigation between routes. It is the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js.

You can use it by importing it from next/link, and passing a href prop to the component:

## useRouter() Hook
The useRouter hook allows you to programmatically change routes.

This hook can only be used inside Client Components and is imported from next/navigation.
